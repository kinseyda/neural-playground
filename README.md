# Neural Playground

<b><i>Neural Playground</i></b> allows users to interact with simple feed-forward neural networks to intuitively see how they improve as they learn more - with learning taking place entirely within the browser in pure Typescript.

Neural Playground is currently in a very early stage of development, this is only a proof of concept for the network-related functionality. Interactivity is currently very limited, console logging is still used for things like time estimates, and the app is very ugly looking.
